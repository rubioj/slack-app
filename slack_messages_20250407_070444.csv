2025-03-10 11:58:39,Cathy Lancaster,"Last week we had this question arise in our IN/MI Cohort for BCBS.  Thoughts/responses?  Seeking the great hive mind!

""How do we define community, particularly when we serve a very large area with very different “micro-communities” and needs throughout? Focusing too broadly allows us to function but also allows missing opportunities to support unique communities properly.""",2 replies
2025-03-12 10:06:01,lbraun,<!channel> we have our IMLS team meeting next week that is usually the session that year 1 and 2 states join and year 3 gets the month off.  This month we’d like to invite everyone to join. Sandra Hughes-Hassell will be facilitating the meeting and giving us all a chance to think more about the sustainability of BCBS.  Year 3 states I’ll update the invite you have for the bi-monthly IMLS team meetings to include next week.  If you can join us that would be great. If not we will fill you in.,No replies
2025-03-19 08:57:32,lbraun,"<!channel> An update on today’s IMLS team meeting. Sandra can’t make it to our meeting today so our agenda is going to change a bit:
• Update/Q&amp;A from those facilitating learning sessions now
• What we would like to work on with you all - Workbook, etc.
• Space to be, talk, etc.
We will meet for just an hour instead of 90 minutes.",1 replies

2025-03-20 05:44:22,lbraun,"<!channel> thanks for the conversation yesterday and for thinking about next steps. This <https://calendly.com/d/crx3-mrk-vrm/bcbs-next-steps|Calendly poll >is to schedule a meeting to talk with an IMLS team sub-group about the next steps in more detail.  If you aren’t able to work on the sub-group project, that’s OK, you don’t need to submit the poll. I’ll *check on who submits on Tuesday* and then get something scheduled. Thanks again everyone.

Also, this is the book Sandra mentioned, <https://www.amazon.com/dp/0300229631?ref=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cso_sms_apin_dp_SCWJS4Q25J255YM99AS7&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cso_sms_apin_dp_SCWJS4Q25J255YM99AS7&amp;social_share=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cso_sms_apin_dp_SCWJS4Q25J255YM99AS7&amp;bestFormat=true|Leading with Dignity> and she said this one is supposed to be better, <https://www.amazon.com/dp/030026142X?ref=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cso_sms_apin_dp_8TW86DXWM9ER5H92P2G3&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cso_sms_apin_dp_8TW86DXWM9ER5H92P2G3&amp;social_share=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cso_sms_apin_dp_8TW86DXWM9ER5H92P2G3&amp;bestFormat=true|Dignity and It’s Essential Role in Resolving Conflict>.",1 replies

2025-04-01 17:48:17,lbraun,"<!channel> while we are living through this wild time I wondered if anyone is interested in taking the othering and belonging targeted universalism class.  It’s free and starts next week. I thought it might be a good way for some or all of us to learn about TU together and also be a good way to continue learning about equitable practices within the context of our current world.  I’m going to signup for the course and let me/us know if you plan to too.  We could use Slack to talk about what we are learning, etc.  Here’s the info.
